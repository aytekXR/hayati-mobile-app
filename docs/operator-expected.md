_Last refreshed: 2026-07-13, Session 022 close + post-merge proof round
(M6.3 — **store metadata TR/EN + the release lane + the performance pass**:
the App Store listing text exists in two languages, the tag-to-TestFlight
pipeline is built AND its missing-secrets boundary was executed and proven
loud (pre-signing stages green, honest red exactly at the gate), and the
app's cold start got structurally faster with the bootstrap shape pinned by
a test; **21/22 units, 95% — the MVP engineering plan is COMPLETE except the
halves only you can unblock**). The TestFlight runbook lives below._

## Expected from you right now: **NOTHING IS BLOCKING — no action was required this session and none was taken on your behalf.** But the finish line is now genuinely yours: **item 6 (pick the AI provider — OVERDUE since Session 019; M5.3 is the ONLY planned session-unit left in the whole MVP, and it waits on this alone)** and **item 4 (the Apple Developer enrollment, promised 2026-07-08 — the release lane is BUILT and waiting: the day you enroll and add three copy-paste secrets, a git tag produces a signed TestFlight build)**. Session 022 also surfaced a small set of **new, non-blocking founder decisions for the store listing** — the store name, the label under the discreet icon, and the missing privacy/support web pages — all listed under the NEW item 8 below. Item 7 (should coach chats ever be saved?) stays open, non-blocking.

**Session 022 needed nothing from you mid-flight.** It wrote the App Store
listing (Turkish and English), built the pipeline that will carry Hayati to
TestFlight, and made the app start faster.

**What you should know from this session:**

**0.1. The App Store listing text now exists — and it needs your eyes (TR) before launch.** `fastlane/metadata/` holds the store name, subtitle, description, and keywords in Turkish and English, written in the brand voice and deliberately claiming nothing the app can't do (the privacy paragraph uses the settings screen's own honest wording). It joins item 1's native-review gate. Two decisions inside it are provisional and YOURS (see item 8): the store name "Hayati" (trademark check pending) and whether the on-device label stays "Hayati App".

**0.2. The release pipeline exists, is honest about what it can't do yet — and has now PROVEN it.** Pushing a version tag runs: metadata lint → the full emulator integration suite → a real release build with a size report → and then a signing step that **deliberately fails with a clear message** telling you exactly which secrets are missing and where they go. The proof run happened at session close: every pre-signing stage green on the first real execution, then the honest red at exactly the signing gate, naming the three missing secrets and pointing at item 4. The moment your enrollment lands and you add the three App Store Connect keys, the same pipeline signs and uploads to TestFlight. Nothing pretends; nothing silently skips. First real measurement from that run: **the app is 64 MB uncompressed** — comfortably small.

**0.3. The app starts faster, provably.** The startup path was audited step by step: a timezone-database parse moved off the critical path, two pairs of independent reads now run simultaneously, and a test now pins the exact set of things allowed to run before the first frame — so no future change can quietly slow the boot. First measured numbers (CI simulator, debug build — diagnostics, not the real thing): app boot work ~435 ms, first frame at ~874 ms. What did NOT change: the privacy lock still decides the very first frame (that is a security guarantee, not an optimization target). The honest cold-start numbers still need a real device — that check is on item 4's on-device list.

**0.4. Two small bugs were caught and fixed in the same session, both by the proof runs, not by luck:** a test broken since yesterday's merge (it predates this session and had gone unnoticed — main is green again), and a size-checker that would have silently passed any app size (it now refuses to pass anything it cannot actually measure).

**1. "Delete my account" now exists, and it means it.** Settings → Delete
account & data. It asks twice (and for your PIN if the lock is on), tells you
plainly that it is irreversible, and then deletes everything: your profile,
your solo reflections, your account — and the **entire shared space, both
sides of every answer**. Your partner keeps what was always theirs alone
(their own profile and solo reflections) and loses the shared thread, same
as you. This was the hardest call of the session and it is yours to overturn:
the alternative — each partner keeps their own half of the thread — is
written out in ADR-019 with the honest costs of both options. We chose whole-
thread deletion because the shared conversation is *about both of you* (a
"deleted" relationship record that leaves one side readable has been
redacted, not erased), and because for someone deleting to *escape* a
relationship, nothing they wrote should survive anywhere the partner can
read. One honest bound, stated in the app's own copy: deletion removes the
server's copies — it cannot un-see what a partner already read or
screenshot.

**2. The partner is told honestly — but deliberately NOT pinged.** No push
notification fires when a deletion happens. The other partner learns from a
calm, non-blaming notice the next time they open Hayati ("your shared space
has been closed and its content permanently deleted; your own reflections
are untouched; you can pair again whenever you choose"). The review's
reasoning, recorded in full: a real-time "your space was closed" alert to a
possibly-abusive partner at the exact moment a victim cuts ties is a safety
risk nothing in the spec requires. If you ever want a push, it is one
decision away, with the analysis already written.

**3. Deleting does NOT cancel a subscription — Apple does not let us.** If
either of you has an active subscription, deletion removes Premium from the
(now gone) couple, but Apple keeps billing until the payer cancels in their
App Store settings. Both the deleter's confirmation screen and the partner's
notice say this in plain words. No app can do this part for you, and we would
rather say so than pretend.

**4. "Download my data" exists too, free for everyone.** Settings → Download
my data produces a JSON document of everything that is YOURS — your profile,
your solo answers, your own halves of the shared answers, your own coach-
usage counts — and deliberately nothing your partner wrote (their answers
are their data, even the ones you can read in the app; a durable exported
copy is a different thing from reading together, and we chose the protective
side). Delivered in-app with copy-to-clipboard — no email involved, which
also means no email provider to set up.

**5. Discreet notifications are now a real setting.** Settings has a new
toggle: when on, every notification shows only "Hayati" and a neutral line,
never what happened. Arabic-language users have had this by default since
M3.4 and still do; the toggle lets anyone opt in (and an Arabic user who
turns it on explicitly keeps the protection even if they later switch the
app's content language).

**6. Nothing changed for the daily loop or the lock** — proven by the same
kind of tests as always (1,300 app-side now, 848 server-side, all green,
both review passes run and their findings fixed before merge).

## ★ NEW (Session 018): native review of the CRISIS content — the one gate before the coach runs on your phones

- **What:** the crisis word-lists (TR / AR incl. Arabizi / EN), the
  professional-help response, the "not therapy" disclaimer, and — NEW since
  Session 019 — **the safety lines of the coach's system-prompt preamble**
  (the "you are not therapy / no medical or legal advice / never claim to be
  human" instructions, written out in TR/AR/EN) are AI-drafted and marked
  `nativeReview: PENDING`. **This review BLOCKS the coach's first run on a
  real device** — an under-reading crisis filter is a safety failure, and
  only native speakers can judge the lists. TR: you two (~15 minutes of
  reading). AR incl. Arabizi: your Gulf reviewer.
- **Also in this gate:** crisis-hotline phone numbers are deliberately NOT
  in the app — a wrong number is dangerous. When you review, choose the
  TR/SA numbers you trust and a session wires them in. (A CI test now fails
  if anyone adds a phone-number-shaped string to the coach copy without
  going through this gate.)
- **Where:** `functions/src/coach/crisis-lexicon.ts` +
  `functions/src/coach/help-content.ts` (help response) +
  `functions/src/coach/persona-prompts.ts` (preamble safety lines); the
  disclaimer moved in Session 019 to its single home in the app copy files
  (`app/lib/core/l10n/arb/app_{tr,ar,en}.arb`, key `coachDisclaimerBody` —
  same strings, new address). Or just send corrections to a session.
- **When:** blocking the first on-device coach use — which rides item 4's
  timeline anyway.

## 6. **DUE NOW** (raised Session 018; due since Session 019): LLM provider decision + API key — M5.3 is waiting on exactly this

- **What:** pick the AI provider for the coach and create an API key. The
  server seam is provider-agnostic; nothing in the code commits to anyone,
  and the choice is reversible.
- **The numbers (published prices per million tokens in/out; ≈ cost per
  coach message at realistic sizes):** Anthropic Claude — Haiku 4.5 $1/$5
  (≈$0.005/msg); Sonnet $3/$15 (≈$0.014/msg; Sonnet 5 intro $2/$10 through
  2026-08-31); Opus 4.8 $5/$25 (≈$0.023/msg). The shipped caps (30/day per
  person, 1,000/month per couple) bound worst-case spend to ≈$14/mo/couple
  at Sonnet pricing. Quality in Gulf Arabic + Turkish is the differentiator;
  OpenAI/Gemini are viable behind the same seam (their prices get pulled
  fresh when you decide — not quoted from memory).
- **When:** **now-ish.** The chat UI is done (Session 019); M5.3 — the first
  live coach conversation — is blocked on this decision alone and was
  SKIPPED in the session ordering because of it (Session 020 builds the app
  lock instead; M5.3 jumps back to the front the moment you answer). Until
  then everything runs on recorded fixtures. The key goes into Secret
  Manager at deploy (like the RC webhook token) — never into the repo.

## 7. NEW (Session 019): should coach conversations ever be SAVED? — the private-thread retention decision

- **What:** today, coach chats are deliberately ephemeral: nothing is stored
  on the server (since M5.1) or on the phone (Session 019 — a fresh app
  start is a fresh conversation; signing out wipes instantly). That is the
  most protective posture for a product that serves people in difficult
  relationships: a saved thread on a shared phone is readable by whoever
  holds it, and the app's device lock doesn't exist yet (it's next session).
  Whether to KEEP it that way is a privacy stance only you can set.
- **The options, honestly:** (a) **ephemeral forever** — simplest, safest,
  zero data anywhere; the cost is that a couple loses coach context whenever
  the app restarts. (b) **a saved private thread per person**
  (`coach_sessions`, auto-deleted after ~30 days) — more useful, but it
  needs: your call on the retention window, rules guaranteeing a partner can
  NEVER read the other's thread, inclusion in the M6 data-export and
  delete-everything flows, and it should not ship before the device lock
  exists. No engineering waits on this — ephemeral works fine indefinitely.
- **When:** whenever you have a view; a session folds it in with rules +
  tests in a day. Until then: ephemeral.

## ★ NEW (2026-07-12, Session 018): you have the iPhone 17 + Mac — the TestFlight runbook

You told Session 018 you now have an **iPhone 17 and a Mac**, and that you will
**register the app on TestFlight and physically test it on your iPhone**. That
changes the posture of item 4 (the Mac was the missing hardware; now the only
gate is your Apple Developer enrollment, promised 2026-07-08) — and it means
you can personally close **half of item 0** (the App Store Connect app record
is Phase B below). Here is the complete runbook, verified against this repo's
actual configuration (bundle id `com.hayati.app`, Sign in with Apple
entitlement already declared, flavor entrypoints `lib/main_dev.dart` /
`lib/main_prod.dart`, fastlane's TestFlight lane deliberately not implemented
until M6 — so your first upload goes through Xcode/Transporter by hand).

### Phase 0 — prerequisites (once)

1. **Verify the enrollment is ACTIVE:** developer.apple.com → Account → your
   membership must say **Apple Developer Program** (paid, $99/yr), not just
   "Apple Developer" (free). Nothing below works on the free tier — TestFlight
   requires the paid program.
2. **Mac:** install **Xcode** from the Mac App Store (latest stable — you need
   a version new enough for the iPhone 17 / current iOS SDK). Launch it once,
   accept the license, let components install. Then Xcode → Settings →
   Accounts → **+** → sign in with your enrolled Apple ID; your team should
   appear.
3. **Mac:** install **Flutter** (stable channel), clone this repo, run
   `flutter doctor` and clear any iOS-section complaints. Then
   `cd app && flutter pub get`. (No CocoaPods needed — this project is
   SwiftPM-first, there is no Podfile.)
4. **iPhone 17:** install the **TestFlight** app from the App Store, signed in
   with the Apple ID you'll invite (using your own enrolled Apple ID is
   simplest).

### Phase A — register the bundle ID (once)

1. developer.apple.com → Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles →
   **Identifiers** → **+** → App IDs → type **App**.
2. Description: `Hayati`. Bundle ID: **Explicit**, exactly **`com.hayati.app`**
   (it is pinned in the Xcode project and `fastlane/Appfile` — a different
   string will not build).
3. Capabilities: tick **Sign in with Apple** (the app's entitlements file
   already declares it — a build without this capability fails validation).
   Push Notifications and App Attest can be added later by editing the App ID
   (that's allowed; Xcode regenerates profiles automatically).
   - Shortcut: if you skip this phase, Xcode's automatic signing (Phase C)
     can register the App ID for you — but doing it in the portal makes the
     capability state explicit, and you need the identifier to exist for
     Phase B anyway.

### Phase B — create the App Store Connect app record (once — this IS half of item 0)

1. appstoreconnect.apple.com → **My Apps** → **+** → **New App**.
2. Platform **iOS** · Name **Hayati** (this is the public/TestFlight display
   name; if Apple says it's taken, pick a variant — it can be changed before
   launch) · Primary language **Turkish** (or English — your call) · Bundle ID
   **com.hayati.app** (appears in the dropdown after Phase A) · SKU
   `hayati-ios` (internal only, never shown) · Full Access.
3. **Do NOT create subscription products yet** unless a session specs them
   with you — and when you do, remember the **irreversible** rule from item 0:
   **leave "Family Sharing" OFF** (ADR-015, one-way door).

### Phase C — build the signed app on the Mac

1. Open `app/ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode → select the **Runner** target →
   **Signing & Capabilities** → tick **Automatically manage signing** → Team:
   your team. Xcode mints the certificate + provisioning profile itself.
2. Build the **prod** flavor for TestFlight (dev points at `hayatiapp-dev`;
   TestFlight builds should carry prod config):

   ```sh
   cd app
   flutter build ipa --release -t lib/main_prod.dart
   ```

   Leave `REVENUECAT_IOS_API_KEY` out until item 0's RevenueCat account
   exists — without it the paywall shows the honest "store unavailable" state
   **by design** (fail-closed), everything else works.
3. Output lands at `app/build/ios/ipa/*.ipa`. Version is pubspec's
   `version: 0.1.0+1` — every later upload needs the build number after the
   `+` bumped (`+2`, `+3`, …).

### Phase D — upload to TestFlight

1. Easiest: install Apple's **Transporter** app (free, Mac App Store) → sign
   in → drag the `.ipa` in → **Deliver**. Alternative: `flutter build ipa`
   also produced `app/build/ios/archive/Runner.xcarchive` — open it in Xcode
   (Window → Organizer) → **Distribute App** → App Store Connect → Upload.
2. ~~First upload asks the **export compliance** question~~ — **already
   handled (Session 022):** `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false` now ships in
   Info.plist (Hayati uses only standard TLS/HTTPS), so Apple will NOT show
   the export-compliance prompt at upload. If it appears anyway, answer
   "only exempt/standard encryption" and tell a session.
3. Processing takes ~5–30 minutes; the build then appears in App Store
   Connect → Hayati → **TestFlight** tab (answer the "Missing Compliance"
   prompt there if it asks again).

### Phase E — install on your iPhone 17

1. TestFlight tab → **Internal Testing** → **+** → create a group (e.g.
   `Founders`) → add yourself as tester. Internal groups get builds
   **instantly, no Beta App Review**, up to 100 testers.
2. Your partner: App Store Connect → Users and Access → invite her Apple ID
   with any modest role, then add her to the internal group. (External
   groups exist too, but they require a Beta App Review pass — internal is
   the right lane for the founder couple.)
3. On the iPhone: open **TestFlight** → the build appears (or accept the
   email invite) → **Install**. Done — Hayati is on your phone.

### What that physical test can honestly prove today — and what it can't yet

- **Works immediately:** app launch, onboarding/brand UI, localization
  (TR/AR/EN, RTL), the solo question flow UI, deep-link delivery
  (`hayati://invite/<code>` — an item-4 checkbox), Sign in with Apple's
  full-name capture (another item-4 checkbox) — **after** you enable the
  Apple sign-in provider in the Firebase console (**item 3, ~5 minutes —
  do it before the first launch or sign-in will fail**).
- **Needs item 2 (Blaze + first deploy) first:** pairing, the daily loop,
  reveal, streaks, entitlements — all six Cloud Functions have **never been
  deployed** (Spark plan). A session scripts the first deploy the moment you
  flip Blaze; without it the app on your phone is a beautiful shell around a
  missing backend.
- **Needs item 0:** any real paywall content and the sandbox purchase (M4's
  accept line). TestFlight builds hit the sandbox store automatically once
  RevenueCat + the subscription products exist.
- **Won't fire yet regardless:** push notifications (APNs + the app-side
  token capture are the item-4 device slice, not built into this binary).

**Recommended order:** Phases 0–B now (registration needs only the
enrollment); flip Blaze (item 2) + enable providers (item 3) next; then let a
session run the first deploy; then Phases C–E for the physical test. If you
want, the next session can be re-pointed at the deploy + TestFlight slice
instead of M5.2 — say so and it will be re-scoped.

## 0. **BLOCKING — the only thing left in M4:** RevenueCat account + App Store Connect app record

- **What:** (a) create a free **RevenueCat account** (revenuecat.com — takes
  minutes, just an email; name the project Hayati and note the **iOS API
  key**); (b) once your **Apple Developer enrollment** (promised 2026-07-08)
  lands, create the **App Store Connect app record** for `com.hayati.app` and
  the subscription products (the session will spec the TR/SAR/USD tiers with
  you). **The app-record half is now step-by-step Phase A+B of the TestFlight
  runbook above** — you can do it yourself the day the enrollment lands.
- **Why it is now BLOCKING (changed at the Session 017 close):** the paywall,
  the purchase plumbing, the entitlement server, and now the transfer handling
  are **all done and waiting**. M4.3 shipped the last of the engineering. There
  is **nothing left to build** toward M4's acceptance line — *a real sandbox
  purchase in TR + SA flipping Premium on both phones* — and no session can
  advance it without these two accounts. M4 is marked "engineering complete,
  sandbox proof pending item 0". The next session moves on to the AI coach (M5)
  and will keep moving on until you unblock this.
- **How the app plugs in (no commitment needed from you to understand it):**
  the iOS API key is passed at build time (`REVENUECAT_IOS_API_KEY`
  dart-define — it is a publishable key, but nothing is committed until you
  decide); without it the app fails closed to the honest "store unavailable"
  state.
- **One security note for later (ADR-013):** when the RC *webhook* is
  eventually configured (that's a deploy-time item, see item 2), its
  `Authorization` token must be a **long random string (≥256-bit)** — it is
  the only thing authenticating RevenueCat to our server. The session will
  generate one with you; don't reuse a human password.
- **⚠️ NEW, and IRREVERSIBLE — when you create the subscription products,
  leave "Family Sharing" OFF** (Session 017 / ADR-015). Apple's own
  documentation is explicit: *once you turn on Family Sharing for an in-app
  purchase, you can't turn it off.* We do not want it: it would require both
  of you to be in the same Apple Family group (shared organizer + payment
  method), and it would create a **second source of entitlement that our
  server does not control** — while our own model already gives both partners
  Premium from one purchase. This is a one-way door, so it is written down
  **before** the products exist. If a session ever helps you create them, it
  will re-check this with you.

## 1. Native review of the solo question content (before public launch)

- **What:** the first shippable content — 7 solo reflection questions ×
  TR/AR/EN — is AI-drafted and marked `reviewedBy: PENDING…`. Per the binding
  authoring rules (`content/README.md`, W9): **native register-owner review is
  mandatory before any public launch — TR by you two, AR by a Gulf-dialect
  reviewer.**
- **Where:** the packs live at **`content/packs/solo_{tr,ar,en}.json`** (the
  single authoring home). Edit there, set `reviewedBy` to the reviewer's name,
  then run `dart content/validator/validate.dart --sync` and commit both
  trees — or just send the edits to a session and it will do the mechanics.
  CI validates every change (the reviewedBy `PENDING` warning disappears once
  set).
- **When needed:** NOT blocking personal use or any engineering session
  (ADR-007 personal-use-first). Becomes a hard gate before TestFlight
  beta/soft launch (M6). Reviewing the TR pack is ~10 minutes of reading; the
  AR pack needs your Gulf reviewer contact.
- **Extra weight since M3.2:** these same 7 questions are the **couple**
  question bank placeholder too (`packConfig` absent → `solo_tr`, ADR-011)
  until the W9 couple packs are authored — your own paired daily loop serves
  them, so edits pay off twice.
- **NEW since M4.2 (same review gate, different text):** the paywall and
  pack-screen copy (~28 strings × TR/AR/EN — "One subscription. Premium for
  both of you.", trial lines, etc.) is AI-drafted in the brandkit voice and
  needs the same native pass before any public launch: TR by you two, AR by
  your Gulf reviewer. It lives in `app/lib/core/l10n/arb/app_{tr,ar}.arb`
  (keys starting `paywall`/`packs`/`packSelection`); edits regenerate on
  `flutter pub get`, or just send corrections to a session. One AR grammar
  fix already landed via review (`تجري المزامنة`); the rest read well but are
  unreviewed by a native.
- **NEW since M5.1 — the CRISIS-content review is tracked separately (the ★
  item near the top) because it is a SAFETY gate, not a polish gate:** the
  crisis word-lists, help response, disclaimer, and (since M5.2) the
  prompt-preamble safety lines block the coach's first on-device run, while
  everything in this item blocks only public launch.
- **NEW since M5.2 (standard gate):** the coach chat copy — 27 strings ×
  TR/AR/EN in `app/lib/core/l10n/arb/` (keys starting `coach`): persona
  names (incl. the Perisi/ملهم naming call), chat labels, quota captions,
  every error message, and the paused-conversation copy — plus the persona
  and register TONE blocks of the system prompts in
  `functions/src/coach/persona-prompts.ts` (their SAFETY lines are in the ★
  gate above). AI-drafted in the brandkit voice; same TR-by-you-two /
  AR-by-your-Gulf-reviewer pass before public launch.
- **NEW since M6.1 (standard gate, but read the two flagged ones):** the lock
  and settings copy — 41 strings × TR/AR/EN in `app/lib/core/l10n/arb/` (keys
  starting `lock`/`settings`). Two of these carry **safety meaning**, not just
  tone, and are worth your eyes even before launch: **(a) the Face ID warning**
  ("anyone whose face or fingerprint is saved on this phone can unlock
  Hayati") — it must land as a plain factual caution, not an accusation, in
  both languages; **(b) the "Forgot PIN?" copy**, which must make clear that
  recovery signs you out rather than quietly letting someone in. The rest
  (cooldown lines, the discreet-icon bound, error states) is standard tone
  review. AI-drafted; TR by you two, AR by your Gulf reviewer.
- **NEW since M6.2 (standard gate, but three strings carry legal/safety
  weight):** the data-rights copy — `dataRights*`/`coupleEnded*`/
  `settingsNotificationPrivacy*` keys × TR/AR/EN in `app/lib/core/l10n/arb/`.
  Worth your eyes specifically: **(a) the deletion confirmation** (it must
  read as genuinely irreversible and say the shared space goes for BOTH of
  you — an under-translated warning here is a legal problem, not a tone
  problem); **(b) the partner's "shared space closed" notice** (it must stay
  calm and non-blaming in TR and AR — it deliberately never says who did it);
  **(c) the "does not cancel your subscription" line** (users will act on
  this sentence with money involved). The rest (export screen, toggle
  captions, error states) is standard tone review.

## 2. Blaze plan decision — **last call, optional bonus otherwise**

- **What:** upgrading `hayatiapp-dev`/`hayatiapp-prod` from Spark (free) to
  **Blaze** (pay-as-you-go) — deploying Cloud Functions requires it.
- **Status:** six Functions now (`createInvite`, `invitePreview`,
  `joinInvite`, the scheduled `questionRollover`, the Firestore-triggered
  `answerReveal`, and since M4.1 the **`revenueCatWebhook`**), all
  emulator-proven; **nothing deployed yet.** Deploy-verified-only pieces: the
  rollover's *schedule trigger* (Cloud Scheduler), `answerReveal`'s
  production retry (Eventarc redelivery), and now the webhook's **Secret
  Manager binding** (`RC_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`) + its public URL for the RC
  dashboard. All handler/service logic is fully proven in-process.
- **When needed:** the optional first deploy + real-device pairing test (which
  also needs your Mac, so on-device stays a bonus either way). Hard requirement
  at latest before the first TestFlight build (M6) — and the RC webhook can
  only be configured against a deployed URL, so the live entitlement loop
  (real sandbox purchase → both phones premium) waits on this too.
- **Cost posture:** couple-scoped workload ≈ near-zero at dev scale — the
  hourly sweep reads O(couples) docs and the webhook is O(1) per event
  (`architecture.md` §10); budget alerts at $ thresholds.

## 3. Enable Apple + Phone sign-in providers (open since M1.3)

- **What:** Firebase console → Authentication → Sign-in method → enable
  **Apple** and **Phone** on **both** projects (`hayatiapp-dev`,
  `hayatiapp-prod`).
- **Why manual:** free-tier Auth provider init is console-only (M1.2 finding) —
  no API/CLI path exists.
- **When needed:** only for **real-device** sign-in; CI/emulator sessions run
  without it. ~5 minutes.

## 4. The Mac / Apple Developer slice (enrollment promised 2026-07-08)

**Update 2026-07-12 (Session 018): the Mac and the iPhone 17 are now in hand —
the only remaining gate on this whole slice is the enrollment itself. The
TestFlight runbook above covers the registration + first-install path; the
checkboxes below remain the on-device verification backlog.**

**Update 2026-07-13 (Session 022): the automated release lane now exists and
waits on exactly this item.** The day the enrollment lands:

1. **Create one App Store Connect API key** (App Store Connect → Users and
   Access → Integrations → Keys → generate; role App Manager is enough) and
   put its three values into GitHub: repo **Settings → Environments →
   `release`** (the environment already exists/auto-creates) → add secrets
   **`ASC_KEY_ID`**, **`ASC_ISSUER_ID`**, **`ASC_API_KEY_P8`** (the .p8 file's
   full text). They must go in the `release` ENVIRONMENT, not the plain
   repository secrets — the pipeline reads only the environment (ADR-021).
2. From then on, a session (or you) pushing a tag `vX.Y.Z` that matches
   `app/pubspec.yaml`'s version produces a signed TestFlight build
   automatically. Until then the pipeline's signing step fails with a clear
   message — that red is expected and honest.
3. **First-real-run checklist (recorded, expected to need one Mac-era fix):**
   the likeliest fixes a session may need are the automatic-signing
   `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` build setting (no secret carries your team id yet) —
   and after the first `deliver` metadata push, eyeball the App Store Connect
   URL fields (the empty privacy/support URLs must not have clobbered
   anything; item 8 owns filling them).
4. **NEW on-device check (Session 022):** the cold-start stopwatch — time a
   cold launch of the prod build on the iPhone 17 (airplane-mode and normal
   runs). CI deliberately does not assert the <2s number (a shared debug
   simulator would produce theater); your phone is where the honest number
   comes from.

Everything here needs your Mac and/or the Apple Developer enrollment:

- **App Attest**: entitlement + console registration, then on-device
  verification. **App Check enforcement stays OFF in both consoles until
  attestation is verified on-device** (current posture in all Functions).
- **APNs** setup (push): **the M3.4 notification logic is done and waiting on
  exactly this** — nudge/reveal/streak-at-risk sends, quiet hours, and
  discreet mode all ship emulator-proven behind a mocked send seam; the
  device half (APNs registration + the app-side `fcmTokens` capture, which
  was deliberately deferred to this slice) is what turns them into real
  pushes on your phones.
- **App Store Connect app record** — now doubly needed: TestFlight (M6) and
  the M4.2/M4.3 subscription products (item 0).
- **dSYM upload** for prod Crashlytics symbolication.
- **Issue #15**: capture the native crash log for the phone-auth emulator
  suite on the iOS simulator.
- On-device confirmation that Apple's first-authorization full name reaches
  `displayName`.
- **Deep-link delivery test** (M2.2/M2.3): `hayati://invite/<code>` cold + warm
  OS→app delivery can only be proven on a device/simulator.
- **NEW (M6.1, ADR-018) — the device-privacy layer's on-device half.** All of
  it is emulator-proven and CI-compiled, but four things can only be seen on a
  real iPhone. When you do the TestFlight install, please check:
  1. **The Keychain round-trip** — set a PIN, force-quit, relaunch: it must ask
     for the PIN. Then **delete the app, reinstall, and launch**: it must STILL
     ask for the PIN (that is the reinstall-bypass defence working; if it opens
     straight into the app, tell a session immediately — that is a real hole).
  2. **The Face ID prompt** — turn it on in Settings, lock the app, unlock with
     Face ID. Then change/add a face in iOS Settings and reopen Hayati: it must
     have switched Face ID **off** by itself and be demanding the PIN.
  3. **The discreet icon** — flip it in Settings. iOS shows its own alert
     ("You have changed the icon for Hayati App") — that is Apple's, expected,
     and not suppressible. Confirm the home-screen icon actually changes, and
     confirm what we told you: the *name* under it does not.
  4. **The app-switcher snapshot** — open the coach or a revealed answer, swipe
     up to the app switcher: the Hayati card must show a **blank panel**, never
     your content. (If any content shows through, there is a known fix — a
     native SceneDelegate cover — recorded in ADR-018 Decision 5.)
- **Universal links** (decision, not urgent): needs enrollment + a hosted
  `apple-app-site-association` → a domain choice. Custom scheme shipped in
  M2.2; upgrade path documented in `architecture.md` §4.
- First **real-device pairing test** (pairs with item 2: deploy first).

## 8. NEW (Session 022): four store-listing decisions + the missing web pages — none blocking, all pre-submission

- **(a) The store name "Hayati" is provisional.** The brandkit records a
  known collision risk (an unrelated vape brand uses "Hayati" in some
  markets). Before public launch: run the trademark/store-name search you
  already planned; if it fails, the vetted alternates are in the brandkit and
  ADR-020 (İkimiz, Baynana, Mawadda, Roohi) and the rename costs one metadata
  line. Apple may also reject the name as taken at Phase B — same fallback.
- **(b) The label under the discreet icon — your call, deliberately not made
  for you (ADR-020 D2).** The home-screen label is "Hayati App" today and the
  discreet icon cannot change it (that honest bound ships in the app's own
  settings copy). Options, all drafted: keep "Hayati App" (current), rename
  to "Hayati" (cleaner, equally identifying), or a genuinely neutral label
  (a real product-identity decision with store-review risk — not drafted as
  a default). Whichever you pick, the session that changes it must re-audit
  the discreet-icon copy in the same commit.
- **(c) Privacy policy + support page URLs do not exist** — the store
  listing ships EMPTY URL fields behind a loud CI warning (never a fake URL).
  Apple requires both at submission. Needs: your domain choice (the same
  decision universal links have been waiting on) + a hosted privacy policy
  TR/AR/EN. **The next session drafts the policy TEXT** (see resume-prompt);
  hosting stays yours. When the URLs exist, a session drops the lint's
  `--allow-empty-urls` flag and the gap can never reopen.
- **(d) Age rating: verify at first submission.** Spice mode is out of the
  MVP precisely to keep the rating standard-tier, but whether Apple's
  questionnaire treats the AI coach chat as a maturity factor is only
  provable in App Store Connect. If it forces a higher tier, the choice
  (constrain the surface vs accept the tier) is yours — the honest answer
  either way is the guardrail description (server-side crisis spine,
  not-therapy disclaimer, premium-gated).
- **Also in item 1's native-review gate since this session:** the full store
  listing copy ×2 locales (`fastlane/metadata/{tr,en-US}` — name, subtitle,
  description, keywords, promotional text) and the localized Face ID
  purpose string (`app/ios/Runner/{en,tr,ar}.lproj/InfoPlist.strings`).

## Parked (cross-project): Unhooked panic-button verification (reported 2026-07-11)

> Not a Hayati item — parked here because this is the checklist you read.
> The **unhooked** iOS panic-control fix sits UNCOMMITTED on your Mac
> (intents moved into the app target + warm-launch gate; unit 151/151,
> snapshot 17/17, status DONE_WITH_CONCERNS). Needed from you, on the Mac /
> iPhone: (1) cold test — app closed, tap Control Center Panic → app must
> launch straight into the panic flow; (2) warm test — app open on the
> dashboard, tap Panic → panic sheet over the dashboard; (3) decide whether
> the swipe-dismissible warm sheet should become a hard cover (the
> celebration screen has no dismiss button — a full cover would trap you);
> (4) let an unhooked Mac session commit via its ritual + run the UI-test
> lane. Optional: gstack 1.39 → 1.60 (`/gstack-upgrade`).

## 5. Slack webhook rotation (from Session 005, still open)

The local branch `chore/slack-notifications` holds commit `13f1e6d` with a
**live incoming-webhook URL**; GitHub push protection rejects it. Rotate the
webhook in Slack (treat it as leaked), store the new one as a **repository
secret**, then rework/land the branch.

## Progress & readiness snapshot (as of Session 022 close)

- **Plan progress:** M0 ✅ · M1 ✅ · M2 ✅ · M3 ✅ · **M4 engineering ✅ (sandbox
  accept line open on item 0)** · **M5: 2/3 (spine + chat UI; M5.3 live
  adapter is founder-blocked on item 6)** · **M6: 3/3 ✅ (M6.1 device-privacy,
  M6.2 data rights, M6.3 store metadata + release lane + perf pass — the
  signed-build/TestFlight half of the M6 accept line is proven fail-closed
  and waits on YOUR item 4 enrollment)** — **21/22 session-units (95%) in 22
  sessions; ONE planned session-unit left to the MVP: M5.3, blocked on item 6
  alone** (M6.5 Android sits outside the 22-unit count and its timing is your
  Gate-3 call). On track; no plan or scope changes in Session 022 (M1's +1
  session remains the only slippage ever). Next session: **the mvp item-12
  legal bundle's buildable half — consent surface + privacy-policy/terms
  drafts TR/AR/EN + the DPA inventory** (also produces the policy text that
  item 8(c)'s missing URL needs), unless you answer item 6 (**M5.3
  preempts**), flip Blaze (**the first-deploy slice preempts**), or
  green-light Android timing (**M6.5**).
- **Readiness: pre-MVP, emulator/CI-proven, nothing deployed, nothing on a
  phone.** Working and proven against emulators + CI: auth, profile + rules,
  the whole pairing loop, the unpaired solo week, the content pipeline, the
  FULL daily loop (server assignment → answer → server-gated mutual reveal →
  streak with grace), the notification *logic*, the **entitlement backbone**
  (RC webhook → couple mirror → app premium decision, replay/out-of-order/
  transfer-proven), the **paywall + premium gating** (annual-first paywall
  over a fully-faked store, the reusable premium gate, free tier
  assertion-protected), the **coach safety spine** (crisis detector
  TR/AR/Arabizi/EN proven against engineered evasions; `coachProxy` with
  server-side premium gate, transactional caps, fail-closed provider seam),
  the **coach chat UI** (premium-only surface with three personas, the
  help-sticky pause enforced app-side, per-device "not therapy" consent,
  honest states for every server outcome, conversations ephemeral by design
  and wiped on sign-out), and now the **device-privacy layer** (the whole app
  behind a PIN at the root — cold start, background-return, deep links and
  pushed routes all gated and test-pinned; the PIN in the Keychain so a
  delete-and-reinstall cannot shed the lock while the sign-in session it
  guards survives; attempt-bounding with escalating cooldowns that survive a
  force-quit; Face ID as a self-revoking shortcut; the app-switcher card
  blanked; the discreet iOS icon), and now the **data-rights layer** (M6.2,
  ADR-019: self-serve in-app JSON export of strictly-your-own data; the hard
  cascade delete — idempotent, resumable, kill-tested at every step,
  concurrency-tested across both partners deleting at once; the partner's
  honest in-app notice with deliberately no push; the entitlement mirror
  dying with the couple; the per-user discreet-notification override — 1,300
  app tests / 848 server tests green, both adversarial review passes run and
  every confirmed finding fixed before merge), and now the **release
  readiness layer** (M6.3, ADR-020/021/022: the App Store listing TR/EN in
  `fastlane/metadata` under a CI lint that enforces Apple's limits; the
  tag-triggered `release.yml` — metadata lint → the full emulator integration
  suite → a real prod release build with a 200 MB size cap → a signing step
  that fails CLOSED with a message naming exactly the missing secrets;
  export-compliance pre-answered in Info.plist; the store's language row
  fixed to TR/AR/EN with the Face ID prompt localized; the cold-start path
  audited and shortened with the pre-frame bootstrap shape pinned by a
  mutation-checked test — 1,305 app tests green, both adversarial review
  passes run, every confirmed finding fixed before merge).
  **What "production-ready" is still missing, honestly:** no deploy has ever
  happened (Spark plan — item 2), the app has never run on a real device
  (Mac/enrollment — item 4), no real purchase has ever been made (item 0),
  push notifications have no device half (APNs — item 4), the coach has no
  live AI provider (item 6 — the ONLY gap left in M5, and the only planned
  MVP unit left at all), the privacy layer's four on-device checks (item 4's
  sub-list) are unverified on real hardware, and the signed-build/TestFlight
  half of the release lane waits on item 4's enrollment + secrets. Call it
  **~95% of the MVP's engineering, 0% of its operational proof.**
  Deferred loudly (nothing silent): seasonal question windows (issue #29), the
  schedule trigger + Eventarc retry + webhook Secret Manager binding
  (deploy-verified at first Blaze deploy), `users.fcmTokens` capture + APNs
  (item 4), **RC-REST reconciliation** (rides item 0 + the deploy era), the
  RC identity-sync retry hardening (first live-key session), the private
  thread (item 7 — founder retention decision; ephemeral until then), the
  coach's live provider adapter + `LLM_API_KEY` (item 6 — DUE), the
  crisis-content native review + hotline numbers (★ — blocks coach-on-device
  only), Remote Config cap binding (deploy era), the coach rate limiter's
  per-instance scope (deploy hardening), a pre-first-message quota meter
  (needs the `coachUsage` watch), `invitePreview.questionText` (W9), Apple
  **Group Purchases** (WWDC26; no RevenueCat support yet), and two
  quarantined tests (ci-debt #36 reveal round-trip listener race, #15
  phone-auth simulator crash — at the >2-forces-stabilization threshold, not
  over it). **Still open from M6.1:** the device-privacy layer's four
  on-device verifications (item 4), a native SceneDelegate snapshot cover
  (only if the on-device check finds the pure-Dart shield leaves a gap — the
  fix is pre-recorded in ADR-018 D5), Android's lock + activity-alias icon
  (M6.5), and a change-PIN flow (today: turn off, turn on — both verify
  first, so it is a convenience gap, not a hole). **New from M6.2
  (ADR-019):** backup-retention alignment with the erasure right (the first
  deploy session inherits it — no backups exist today, so "deleted" is
  currently literal), export rate-limiting (deploy hardening, rides the
  existing limiter note), the AR discreet-default opt-out (a recorded product
  decision — the enum leaves the door open), `coach_sessions` export/cascade
  coverage (contingent on your item 7), and consent screens + the DPA
  inventory (the mvp item-12 legal bundle, pre-launch — architecture §8 now
  says "unbuilt" honestly instead of asserting them; **the next session's
  objective**). **New from M6.3 (ADR-020/021/022):** the store-listing E2E
  matrix enters `release.yml` when the E2E scenarios can honestly run
  (sandbox = items 0+4; recorded in test-suite.md), the `Gemfile.lock` debt
  survives until the signing job first runs bundler, the 200 MB size cap
  ratchets once real measurements exist, the `--allow-empty-urls` lint flag
  drops when item 8(c)'s URLs exist, screenshots are Mac-era, and the
  first-real-run signing checklist (item 4's update) carries the two
  recorded likely fixes.
  **Closed this session:** the M6 milestone itself — store metadata TR/EN
  drafted + CI-linted, the release lane built and proven fail-closed at its
  secrets boundary (the last M6 accept line's buildable half; the signed
  half is item 4's), the performance pass (bootstrap audited + shortened +
  sentinel-pinned, build-size cap live, crash-free posture audited), and
  ADR-018 D7's Info.plist localization deferral.
